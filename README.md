# Student-Leave Record Crawler
> This program can automatic get the student-leave record from the **NTU** website.  
>   
> When I was a TA, I have to login the website by teacher's account and copy 
> all of the data from the web. It usually have a plenty of pages to copy. It's 
> a very time-consuming procedure, so I program the code to deal with this problem.
> Now, you can only input your account information and the searching duration 
> and get the whole record. No need to use your 'Ctrl+C' and 'Ctrl+v'.
